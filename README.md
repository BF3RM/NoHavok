# NoHavok
A mod for Venice Unleashed that would be considered useless for most.

This mod replaces the StaticModelGroupEntity entries with regular entities.
The entities will no longer be merged, allowing you to manipulate each of them individually.

It works by using a precompiled list of transforms that were originally stored in the HKX format.

Don't use this mod if you don't know what you're doing.
